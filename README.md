# WRRSimulation--Project-2
Weighted Round Robin (WRR) is a classical packet scheduling discipline in computer networks that extends the basic Round Robin algorithm by introducing weights for each traffic queue. Instead of serving exactly one packet per cycle, WRR allows each queue to transmit a number of packets proportional to its assigned weight.
